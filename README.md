# MiddLaundryLive.FinalCSCI435
This is the final write-up and all information related to our embedded system and code

###Introduction

Laundry availability is a recurring challenge across many college campuses, and Middlebury is no exception. As residents, we frequently found ourselves walking to the laundry room only to discover that every washer was in use. With roughly 300 residents in some dorms and as few as six washers available- approximately fifty students assigned to each machine in some cases -the lack of information about real-time machine usage often led to frustration, wasted time, and inconsistent access. Through this project, we aimed to address this problem directly by building an embedded system and web interface that track washer and dryer availability and make that information accessible to students in real time BEFORE they even leave their rooms.
Our project, MiddLaundryLive, integrates a compact embedded sensor system with a cloud-connected website. The embedded system uses an ESP32 microcontroller paired with an Adafruit LSM6DSOX 6-DoF accelerometer to detect whether a laundry machine is running based on its vibration state. This data of that acceleration is transmitted over WiFi using the Middlebury IoT network and MQTT protocol, and our website retrieves and visualizes these machine states for students to view instantly.
We chose this project because it directly improves everyday student life while allowing us to explore multiple domains of embedded systems design: sensor data processing, microcontroller programming, WiFi communication, MQTT messaging, and frontend web development. The project offered a natural progression from hardware understanding to real-world application- something we both felt would work as a perfect final for this course. We consulted multiple resources to understand the LSM6DSOX sensor, the MQTT protocol, ESP32 WiFi programming using Arduino IDE, and other sources that helped us compare methods and refine our vibration detection algorithm. These included the Adafruit LSM6DSOX datasheet, documentation for HiveMQ and MQTT client libraries, and many more which will all be linked at the end of our report.
Our report explains how we built MiddLaundryLive from the ground up, including hardware design, software logic, interface development, testing, and eventual results. We aim to make this report detailed and instructional enough so that anyone with similar hardware could recreate our prototype.
